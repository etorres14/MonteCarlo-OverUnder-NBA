# MonteCarlo-OverUnder-NBA


- Using NBA player game logs data of the 21'/22' NBA season, created  functions on Python to generate odds for over / under  betting via Monte Carlo simulations.
- Web-scrapped and cleaned player game logs data. Then stored the data in a database created in Python via sqlite3.

Improvements: Instead of a seperate function for each statistic, create a single function where I could add a parameter "statistic" to look for the odds of that specific statistic.
